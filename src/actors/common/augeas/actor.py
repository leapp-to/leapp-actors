""" Check _actor.yaml for detailed description of inputs and examples.


Note: We include additional non-default lenses from the "lenses" directory
      using the --include directive.
      These lenses may override the default augeas lenses.
      TODO: this could be probably removed after recursive processing support?


TODO:

- Add support for multiple configuration instances. Instead of specifying
  lens, directives, load_files and prefix_for_relative only for one specific
  lens (e.g. Httpd), make sure that uper can pass to this actor list of such
  configuration instances (e.g. Httpd, SQL, Wordpress). Then, let this actor
  compute necessary transformations for all of them, instead of only for one.


Possible Improvements:

- Could We run augtool with -A/--noautoload? That way, only specific lens will
  will be loaded (bacause we include it with -t/--transform). We will get the
  gathered data much faster but will activate only one lens (probably
  Probably could support non-required input flag that turns this on.

- Providing prefix for directive argument paths could be automatized by running
  vanilla augeas actor before resolving directives. Then put output of augeas
  actor to relevant scanner and extract root directory.
  After that, run this module.

        Augeas Output
        -------------

         The output XML is nested collection of key-values based on file system
         structure:

             /etc/httpd.conf/DocumentRoot/Value
             /etc/httpd.conf/IfModule/mime_type/
             ...

         So until a certain depth, the chain of key-values represents a file path,
         and the remaining key-values represent parsed elements from the file.

        So based on this layout, the general algorithm is as follows:

        1) Iterate first level of nodes
        2) Check if the current node represents a real file-system path to a file
         2.a) File Path
              Children nodes of the current node are recursively converted to dictionaries
              holding nodes properties
         2.a.a) Lens for the pathh is found, in worst case scenario we need to iterate over
                all lenses (N) and all their `inclusive` paths (M), so this operation is very expensive
                since we need to call `fnmatch` NÃ—M times per each file path
         2.a.b) Property elements are recursively descended using `_rec_props()` function
                which returns the whole property tree
         2.b) Non-File Path
              Intermediary component of the path i.e. directory - recurse using `_rec` until we hit 2.a)
        3) All data are accumulated in `data` variable

            The original XML preserves order of declaration so we do as well and hence use
            `OrderedDict` for dictionaries here. Preserving order of declarations is important
            because we want to see configuration directives in the same order they were declared in
